Hi!

This is it. Pretty much a history of Farbrausch tools 2001-2011. We've been
meaning to release all this for ages, in various forms, and always ended up
not doing it because "we'd just have to clean it up a bit first...".

No more. This is *not* cleaned up. This is the raw deal, some from old hard
drives, some fresh from various SVN repositories. This is code written for
a bunch of different versions of Visual Studio. Some of it is really tricky
to compile, some really easy. There's some nice clean stuff there, other parts
are just a complete mess.

I haven't tried to get any of this to run. I'll probably go over everything
and try to get it to compile with VS2010 soon, but no promises - if I can't
get it to work, then well, it won't compile :). You can still look at the
source, of course.

All of this is released either under a BSD license or put in the public
domain (stated per project). Not that you're likely to want to use most of
this code, but if you want to, we see no reason to keep you.

So what do we have in here? Here's the basic directory structure:

  genthree/             - GenThree. Used for Candytron and nothing else.
    data/               - Candytron data files.
  kkrunchy/             - kkrunchy 0.23alpha code (latest I could find)
  kkrunchy_k7/          - kkrunchy_k7 0.23a3 (didn't find a4; need to re-check)
  ktg/                  - OpenKTG texture generator. See below.
  lekktor/              - May summon Eldritch Abominations. Handle with care.
  RG2/                  - RauschGenerator 2. Used for several 64k intros.
    flybye/             - data file for fr-013: flybye
    welcome_to/         - data files for fr-024: welcome to...
  werkkzeug3/           - Werkkzeug3. Used for tons of demos and intros.
    data/               - Data for kkrieger, Project: Snowblind and others.
      debris/           - Source data for fr-041: debris.
    w3texlib/           - Werkkzeug 3 texture lib. Piece of crap. :)
    wz_mobile/          - Werkkzeug Mobile. Never got used for anything.
  werkkzeug3_kkrieger/  - kkrieger branch. Game mode in here might work. :)

So, here's the sightseeing tips:
* "ktg" is OpenKTG, a proposal for a simple but relatively powerful and
  orthogonal subset of texture generation functions - designed around 2007.
  This is really nice, clean code. If you want to generate textures for WebGL
  or something like that, turning this into pixel shaders+JS code should work
  quite well. (There's no nice editor for it, though)
* GenThree contains a bunch of text files in German with various ideas, from
  the Candytron timeframe - mostly written by Chaos. Interesting bit of
  history :)
* werkkzeug3 is a mess, but come on, debris - you know you want to... :)
